I'd be happy to help you solve this problem. Here's how we can approach it:\n\nLet's start by using the information given in the problem:\n\n* Katie's team won the game and scored 12 points total.\n* Katie scored 4 of the points.\n* Everyone else on the team scored 4 points each.\n\nNow, let's think about how we can use these pieces of information to find out how many players were on Katie's team.\n\nIf Katie scored 4 points and everyone else scored 4 points each, that means that the total number of points scored by everyone else is 4 x (number of players - 1), where \"number of players\" is the number of players on Katie's team.\n\nSo, if we want to find out how many players were on Katie's team, we can set up the following equation:\n\n4 (number of players - 1) = 12\n\nNow, we can solve for \"number of players\" by subtracting 1 from both sides of the equation:\n\n4(number of players) = 12\n\nDividing both sides of the equation by 4 gives us:\n\nnumber of players = 3\n\nTherefore, there were 3 players on Katie's team.\n\nI hope this helps!
