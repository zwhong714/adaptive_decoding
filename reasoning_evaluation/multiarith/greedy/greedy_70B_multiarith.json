Next, we need to find out how long it will take the painter to paint each of the remaining rooms. We are given that it takes 7 hours to paint each room, so we can multiply the number of remaining rooms by 7 to get the total time it will take to paint them:\n\n7 rooms \\* 7 hours/room = 49 hours\n\n3. Finally, we need to add the total time it will take to paint the remaining rooms to the time the painter has already spent painting the first 5 rooms. We are given that it takes 7 hours to paint each room, so the painter has already spent 5 rooms \\* 7 hours/room = 35 hours painting the first 5 rooms.\n\nTherefore, the total time it will take the painter to paint all 12 rooms is:\n\n35 hours + 49 hours = 84 hours\n\nSo, the painter will take 84 hours to paint all 12 rooms.\n\nI hope this helps!

How many shelves did they use?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\nTo start, let's identify the information we have:\n\n* The store had 27 coloring books in stock.\n* They ended up putting them on sale and getting rid of 6 of them.\n* They put the ones they still had onto shelves with 7 on each shelf.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many coloring books the store has after the sale. We can do this by subtracting the number of books they got rid of (6) from the original number of books they had (27):\n\n27 - 6 = 21\n\nSo, the store has 21 coloring books left.\n2. Next, we need to find out how many shelves the store needs to put the books on. We can do this by dividing the number of books by the number of books per shelf (7):\n\n21 \u00f7 7 = 3\n\nSo, the store needs 3 shelves to put all the coloring books on.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the question is: 3 shelves.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

We can't have negative pastries. Let's check our math again.\n\nHmm, it looks like we made a mistake. We subtracted 29 cookies from 20 cupcakes, but we shouldn't have. We should have added the number of cookies to the number of cupcakes.\n\nSo, let's try again. Wendy had 20 cupcakes and 29 cookies, for a total of 20 + 29 = 49 pastries.\n\nSince Wendy had 24 pastries left after the sale, we know that she sold 49 - 24 = 25 pastries.\n\nTherefore, Wendy sold 25 pastries at the school bake sale.\n\nI hope that helps!

To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as follows:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many windows are left to be installed. We can do this by subtracting the number of windows already installed (5) from the total number of windows needed (14). This gives us:\n\n14 - 5 = 9\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how long it will take to install each of the remaining windows. We are given that it takes 4 hours to install each window, so we can simply multiply the number of windows left to be installed (9) by 4 hours per window:\n\n9 windows \\* 4 hours/window = 36 hours\n\n3. Finally, we add the total number of hours it will take to install the remaining windows (36 hours) to the total number of hours already spent installing the first 5 windows (5 windows \\* 4 hours/window = 20 hours):\n\n20 hours + 36 hours = 56 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take the builder 56 hours to install the rest of the windows.\n\nI hope this step-by-step explanation helps you understand how to solve this problem!

First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the team. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who didn't get picked (15) from the total number of students (25):\n\n25 - 15 = 10\n\nSo, 10 students were picked for the team.\n2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left over after the 10 students were picked. We can do this by subtracting the number of students picked (10) from the total number of students (25):\n\n25 - 10 = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 students left over.\n3. Now, we need to divide the remaining 15 students into 2 groups. We can do this by dividing 15 by 2:\n\n15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round up to the nearest whole number.
