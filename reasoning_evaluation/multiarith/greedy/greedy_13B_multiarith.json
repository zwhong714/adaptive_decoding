If he started with 5 decks and by the end of the day he had 3 left, how much money did he earn?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say the magician sold x decks of cards.\n2. We know that he started with 5 decks, so 5 - x decks were sold.\n3. Each deck costs $2, so the total amount of money the magician earned is 2x dollars.\n4. Since he sold 5 - x decks, he earned 2(5 - x) dollars.\n5. Now we need to find out how much money the magician earned in total. We can do this by adding the amount of money he earned from selling each deck:\n\n2x dollars + 2(5 - x) dollars = 2x dollars + 2(5) - 2x dollars\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n2x dollars + 10 dollars - 2x dollars = 10 dollars\n\nSolving for x:\n\n2x = 10 - 2x\n\nx = 8\n\nSo the magician sold 8 decks of cards and earned $16 (2 x 8).\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is $16.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. First, let's determine how many trips Roger will need to make to pick up the trays from the first table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, and there are 10 trays on the table, he will need to make:\n\n10 / 4 = 2 trips\n\n2. Now, let's determine how many trips Roger will need to make to pick up the 2 trays from the second table. Since he can only carry 4 trays at a time, and there are 2 trays on the table, he will need to make:\n\n2 / 4 = 0.5 trips (since 0.5 is the same as 1/2, so Roger will only need to make half a trip to pick up the 2 trays)\n\n3.

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say the magician sold x decks of cards.\n2. We know that he started with 16 decks, so 16 - x decks were sold.\n3. Each deck costs $7, so the total amount of money the magician earned is 7 x (16 - x) = 7 x 16 - 7x.\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get 7 x 16 - 7x = 7 x 16 - 7(16) = 7 x 16 - 112.\n5. Now we need to find out what x is. We know that x is the number of decks the magician sold.\n6. We can set up an equation: 7 x 16 - 112 = x.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 12.\n\nSo, the magician sold 12 decks of cards and earned $7 x 16 - 112 = $7 x 16 - 112 = $112.\n\nI hope that helps!

If each one costs $8, how much money would he need to finish his collection?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! To find out how much money Jerry needs to finish his collection, we can use the following steps:\n\n1. First, we know that Jerry already has 7 action figures, so we can start by adding the cost of those figures to the total amount he needs.\n2. Each action figure costs $8, so the total cost of the 7 figures Jerry already has is:\n\n7 x $8 = $56\n\nSo, Jerry already has $56 worth of action figures.\n3. Next, we know that Jerry needs 16 action figures in total, so we can subtract the number of figures he already has from the total he needs:\n\n16 - 7 = 9\n\nSo, Jerry needs 9 more action figures to complete his collection.\n4. Since each action figure costs $8, the total cost of the 9 additional figures Jerry needs is:\n\n9 x $8 = $72\n\nSo, Jerry needs a total of $72 to finish his collection.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is:\n\n$56 (the cost of the action figures Jerry already has) + $72 (the cost of the 9 additional figures he needs) = $128\n\nI hope that helps!

So, there are no music files left on her flash drive.\n\nNow, let's talk about the video files. Amy had 21 video files, and if she deleted 23 files, that means she deleted 21 video files (since 23 - 4 = 21, where 4 is the number of music files she had). So, there is one video file left on her flash drive.\n\nTherefore, after deleting 23 files, Amy has one video file left on her flash drive.\n\nI hope that helps!

Let's say each player had x lives before they quit. Since there were 8 players, we can write the equation:\n\nx + x + x + x + x + x + x + x = 8\n\n2. Since 5 players quit, we know that x + x + x + x + x = 5\n\n3. Now we can solve the system of equations. We can start by solving the second equation for x:\n\nx = 5\n\n4. Now, we can substitute the value of x into the first equation:\n\nx + x + x + x + x + x + x = 8\n\n5. Substituting x = 5, we get:\n\n5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 + 5 = 8\n\n6.

If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as follows:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of shirts that can be washed in one load.\n\nSince the washing machine can only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, we know that we can wash 43 shirts in 9 loads (43 / 5 = 9).\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of sweaters that can be washed in one load.\n\nSince a sweater is a larger item than a shirt, we can assume that it takes up two spaces in the washing machine. Therefore, we can wash 2 sweaters in one load.\n\nStep 3: Determine the total number of loads needed to wash all 43 shirts and 2 sweaters.\n\nTo wash all 43 shirts, we need 9 loads (as determined in Step 1). To wash the 2 sweaters, we need 1 load (since each sweater takes up two spaces). Therefore, the total number of loads needed is 9 + 1 = 10.\n\nSo, to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters, Sarah would need to do 10 loads of laundry.\n\nI hope this helps!

If you had 6 carnations and 19 roses, how many vases would you need to hold the flowers?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation:\n\nLet x be the number of vases needed to hold the flowers.\n\nSince each vase can hold 5 flowers, we know that:\n\n6 carnations + 19 roses = 5x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 6 from both sides of the equation:\n\n6 carnations + 19 roses - 6 = 5x - 6\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n19 roses = 5x - 12\n\nNow, we can solve for x by multiplying both sides of the equation by 5:\n\n19 roses x 5 = 5x - 12 x 5\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n95 = 5x - 60\n\nNow, we can solve for x by adding 60 to both sides of the equation:\n\n95 + 60 = 5x + 60\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n155 = 5x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 5 to solve for x:\n\n155 / 5 = x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n31 = x\n\nTherefore, we need 31 vases to hold the 6 carnations and 19 roses.\n\nI hope this helps!

If each player left had 6 lives, how many lives did they have total?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. First, let's find out how many players quit:\n8 players quit, so there are 8 players less than the original 13 players.\n2. Next, let's find out how many lives each player had:\nEach player had 6 lives, so the total number of lives for all 13 players is:\n13 x 6 = 78 lives\n3. Now, let's subtract the number of lives each player had before they quit:\nSince 8 players quit, we need to subtract 8 x 6 = 48 lives from the total number of lives.\n4. Finally, we have the total number of lives left for the remaining 5 players:\n78 - 48 = 30 lives\n\nSo, the remaining 5 players have a total of 30 lives.\n\nI hope that helps!

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say Bianca picked x bad carrots, since she picked 26 carrots in total.\n2. Her mother picked 15 carrots, so she picked y bad carrots.\n3. We know that only 16 of the carrots were good, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + y = 26 (Bianca's carrots)\n\nSince only 16 of the carrots were good, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + y - 16 = 26 - 16\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + y = 10\n\n4. Now we can solve for x and y. We know that Bianca picked 26 carrots, so we can substitute that into the equation:\n\nx + y = 26\n\nSubtracting y from both sides gives us:\n\nx = 26 - y\n\n5. Now we can substitute the value of y, which we found in step 3:\n\nx = 26 - 10\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx = 16\n\nSo Bianca picked 16 bad carrots.\n\nI hope this helps!

If she only used 70 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Lana pick?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution:\n\nLet's say Lana picked x tulips and y roses. We know that she picked a total of 70 flowers, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + y = 70\n\nWe also know that Lana picked 36 tulips and 37 roses, so we can set up two more equations:\n\nx + 36 = 37\ny + 37 = 70\n\nNow we can solve the system of equations. First, we can solve the second equation for y:\n\ny = 70 - 37\ny = 33\n\nNow we can substitute y = 33 into the first equation:\n\nx + 36 = 37\nx + 36 - 36 = 37 - 36\nx = 1\n\nSo Lana picked 1 tulip and 33 roses.\n\nTherefore, Lana picked 33 extra roses.\n\nI hope that helps!
