If he started with 5 decks and by the end of the day he had 3 left, how much money did he earn?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! Here's the solution to the problem step by step:\n\n1. The magician started with 5 decks of cards, so he had 5 x 2 = 10 dollars worth of decks.\n2. If he sold all 5 decks, he would have earned 5 x 2 = 10 dollars.\n3. But he didn't sell all 5 decks. Let's say he sold x decks.\n4. So, he has 5 - x decks left.\n5. Each deck he sold earned him 2 dollars, so he earned 2x dollars in total.\n6. Since he has 5 - x decks left, he has 5 - x x = 5 - 2x dollars left.\n7. The magician earned 2x dollars in total, so he has 5 - 2x dollars left.\n8. Now we can solve for x, the number of decks the magician sold.\n\n5 - 2x = 2x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 3\n\nSo, the magician sold 3 decks.\n\n9. Now we can calculate how much money the magician earned:\n\n2x = 2 x 3 = 6 dollars\n\nThe magician earned 6 dollars.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is 6 dollars.\n\nI hope this helps!

If he started with 12 decks and by the end of the day he had 7 left, how much money did he earn?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say the magician sold x decks of cards.\n2. We know that he started with 12 decks, so 12 - x decks were sold.\n3. Each deck costs $9, so the total amount of money the magician earned is 9 x (12 - x) = 9 x 12 - 9x.\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get 9 x 12 - 9x = 9 x 12 - 9(12 - x) = 9 x 12 - 9x = 9 x 12 - 9x.\n5. Now we can solve for x by subtracting 9x from both sides of the equation: 9 x 12 - 9x = 9 x 12 - 9x.\n6. This gives us 9x = 9 x 12 - 9x = 9 x 12 - 9x = 0.\n7. Therefore, x = 0, and the magician sold 0 decks.\n8. Since the magician started with 12 decks and sold 0 decks, he has 12 decks left at the end of the day.\n9. So, the magician earned $0, because he didn't sell any decks.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is $0.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say the magician sold x decks of cards.\n2. We know that he started with 16 decks, so 16 - x decks were sold.\n3. Each deck costs $7, so the total amount of money the magician earned is 7 x (16 - x) = 7 x 16 - 7x.\n4. Simplifying the expression, we get 7 x 16 - 7x = 7 x 16 - 7(16) = 7 x 16 - 112.\n5. Now we need to find out what x is. We know that x is the number of decks the magician sold.\n6. We can set up an equation: 7 x 16 - 112 = x.\n7. Solving for x, we get x = 12.\n\nSo, the magician sold 12 decks of cards and earned $7 x 16 - 112 = $7 x 16 - 112 = $112.\n\nI hope that helps!

If each page has the same number of problems on it, how many problems are on each page?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n1. Sarah had 60 homework problems in total.\n2. She finished 20 of them, so she has 60 - 20 = 40 problems left to do.\n3. Each page has the same number of problems, so we can set up a ratio to represent the number of problems on each page. Let's say there are x problems on each page.\n4. Since Sarah has 40 problems left to do, she must have x pages, where x is the number of problems on each page.\n\nNow, let's solve for x. We can do this by dividing the number of problems left to do (40) by the number of problems on each page (x):\n\n40 / x = ?\n\nCan you think of a value for x that would make this equation true?", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

If she had to wash 43 shirts and 2 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as follows:\n\nStep 1: Determine the number of shirts that can be washed in one load.\n\nSince the washing machine can only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, we know that we can wash either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 shirts in one load. Let's try each of these options to see which one works.\n\nStep 2: Determine the number of loads needed for the shirts.\n\nIf we wash 0 shirts in one load, we'll need to do 43/0 = 43 loads. This is not a viable option, so let's try washing 1 shirt in one load.\n\nIf we wash 1 shirt in one load, we'll need to do 43/1 = 43 loads. This is still not a viable option, so let's try washing 2 shirts in one load.\n\nIf we wash 2 shirts in one load, we'll need to do 43/2 = 21 loads. This is still not a viable option, so let's try washing 3 shirts in one load.\n\nIf we wash 3 shirts in one load, we'll need to do 43/3 = 14 loads. This is still not a viable option, so let's try washing 4 shirts in one load.\n\nIf we wash 4 shirts in one load, we'll need to do 43/4 = 10 loads. This is the correct answer!\n\nStep 3: Determine the number of loads needed for the sweaters.\n\nSince the washing machine can only wash 5 pieces of clothing at a time, we know that we can wash either 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 sweaters in one load. Let's try each of these options to see which one works.\n\nIf we wash 0 sweaters in one load, we'll need to do 2/0 = 2 loads.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

If only 10 of them got called back, how many students didn't make the cut?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that!\n\n     To find out how many students didn't make the cut, we need to first find out how many students made the cut. In this case, we know that 10 students were called back, so we can start by subtracting the number of students who made the cut from the total number of students who tried out:\n\n     Total number of students who tried out = 17 (girls) + 32 (boys) = 59\n\n     Number of students who made the cut = 10\n\n     So, to find out how many students didn't make the cut, we can subtract the number of students who made the cut from the total number of students who tried out:\n\n     Number of students who didn't make the cut = 59 - 10 = 49\n\n     Therefore, 49 students did not make the cut for the basketball team.\n\n     I hope this helps!

Let's work through the problem step by step.\n\n1. First, we know that the store had 48 coloring books in stock to start with.\n2. Then, they put them on sale and got rid of 38 of them. So, the number of coloring books they have left is:\n48 - 38 = 10\n3. Now, they put the remaining 10 coloring books onto shelves with 5 on each shelf. So, we can set up an equation to represent this:\n10 = 5 + 5 + ... + 5 (5 times)\n4. Since there are 5 shelves, we can write:\n10 = 5 x 2 (2 shelves with 5 books each) + 5 (1 shelf with 5 books)\n5.

Since 4 couldn't come, we need to subtract 4 from 9:\n\n9 - 4 = 5\n\nSo, there are 5 friends who can come to the party.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes each friend can have. Since each friend can have exactly 8 cupcakes, we can multiply 5 (the number of friends) by 8:\n\n5 x 8 = 40\n\nSo, we need to buy 40 cupcakes in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is 40 cupcakes.\n\nI hope this helps!

If she had to wash 19 shirts and 8 sweaters how many loads would she have to do?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to determine how many loads Nancy would need to do based on the number of items she has to wash and the capacity of her washing machine.\n\nLet's start by identifying the information we have:\n\n* Nancy has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash.\n* Her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time.\n\nNow, let's think step by step:\n\n1. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed all 19 shirts at once?\n2. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed all 8 sweaters at once?\n3. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed a combination of shirts and sweaters?\n\nLet's start by answering the first question:\n\n1. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed all 19 shirts at once?\n\nSince Nancy's washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, she would need to do 2 loads of shirts (19 / 9 = 2).\n\nNow, let's answer the second question:\n\n2. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed all 8 sweaters at once?\n\nSince Nancy's washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, she would need to do 1 load of sweaters (8 / 9 = 1).\n\nNow, let's answer the third question:\n\n3. How many loads would Nancy need to do if she washed a combination of shirts and sweaters?\n\nSince Nancy has 19 shirts and 8 sweaters to wash, and her washing machine can only wash 9 pieces of clothing at a time, she would need to do a combination of 2 loads of shirts and 1 load of sweaters.\n\nTherefore, Nancy would need to do a total of 3 loads of laundry: 2 loads of shirts and 1 load of sweaters.\n\nI hope this helps!

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say Bianca picked x bad carrots, since she picked 26 carrots in total.\n2. Her mother picked 15 carrots, so she picked y bad carrots.\n3. We know that only 16 of the carrots were good, so we can set up the equation:\n\nx + y = 26 (Bianca's carrots)\n\nSince only 16 of the carrots were good, we can subtract 16 from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + y - 16 = 26 - 16\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\nx + y = 10\n\n4. Now we can solve for x by subtracting y from both sides of the equation:\n\nx = 10 - y\n\nSo, Bianca picked 10 - y bad carrots, and her mother picked y bad carrots.\n\n5. Finally, we can find out how many bad carrots they have in total by adding Bianca's and her mother's bad carrots together:\n\nTotal bad carrots = x + y\n\nSubstituting x = 10 - y and y = 15, we get:\n\nTotal bad carrots = 10 - y + 15\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nTotal bad carrots = 10 - 15\n\nTotal bad carrots = -5\n\nTherefore, Bianca and her mother have 5 bad carrots in total.\n\nI hope this helps!

If she can finish 8 problems in an hour how long will it take her to finish all the problems?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! \ud83d\ude0a\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to first find out how long it will take Nancy to finish the math problems. We can do this by dividing the number of math problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour:\n\n17 problems \u00f7 8 problems/hour = 2 hours\n\nSo, it will take Nancy 2 hours to finish all the math problems.\n\nNow, let's find out how long it will take her to finish the spelling problems. We can do this by dividing the number of spelling problems by the number of problems she can finish in an hour:\n\n15 problems \u00f7 8 problems/hour = 1.88 hours (since we can't have a fraction of an hour, we'll round up to 2 hours)\n\nSo, it will take Nancy 2 hours to finish all the spelling problems as well.\n\nTherefore, in total, it will take Nancy 2 + 2 = 4 hours to finish all her homework. \ud83d\udcdd\n\nI hope this helps!

If she only used 10 of the flowers though, how many extra flowers did Katie pick?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the solution:\n\nLet's say Katie picked x tulips and y roses. We know that she picked a total of 3 + 9 = 12 flowers.\n\nSince she only used 10 flowers, we know that x + y = 10.\n\nNow we can solve for x and y. We can start with y, since we know that Katie picked 9 roses:\n\ny = 10 - x\n\nNow, we can substitute x = 3 (since Katie picked 3 tulips):\n\ny = 10 - 3\n\ny = 7\n\nNow we know that Katie picked 7 roses. To find out how many extra flowers she picked, we can subtract the number of flowers she used (10) from the total number of flowers she picked:\n\nx + y = 10 - (10)\n\nx + y = 0\n\nx = 0\n\nSo, Katie picked 0 extra flowers.

If each van can hold 4 people and there are 2 students and 6 adults going, how many vans will they need?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we can use a simple equation:\n\nLet x be the number of vans needed.\n\nSince each van can hold 4 people, we know that:\n\n2 students + 6 adults = 4x\n\nNow, we can solve for x by subtracting 2 from both sides of the equation:\n\n2 students + 6 adults - 2 = 4x - 2\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n6 adults = 4x\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 4 to solve for x:\n\nx = 6 / 4\n\nx = 1\n\nSo, Debby's class will need 1 van to transport all the students and adults.\n\nI hope this helps!
