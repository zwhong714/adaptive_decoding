So, we can set up the equation:\n\n$7x = 8 - x\n\nSolving for x, we get:\n\nx = 8 - $7x\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\nx = 8 - $7(7)\n\nx = 8 - $49\n\nx = 4\n\nSo, the magician sold 4 decks.\n\nTherefore, the magician earned $7x = $7(4) = $28 from selling the decks.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much money the waiter earned from the customers who did leave a tip. Since 5 out of 9 customers left a tip, and each customer left $8, the total amount earned from tips is:\n\n5 customers x $8 each = $40\n\nSo, the waiter earned $40 from tips.\n\n2. Now, let's find out how much money the waiter earned from the customers who didn't leave a tip. Since 4 out of 9 customers didn't leave a tip, and each customer spent $8, the total amount spent by these customers is:\n\n4 customers x $8 each = $32\n\nSo, the waiter earned $32 from the customers who didn't leave a tip.\n\n3.
