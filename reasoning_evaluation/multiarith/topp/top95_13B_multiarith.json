How many cats do they have left?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. First, let's find out how many Siamese cats were sold:\n\n15 cats x $20 each = $300\n\nSo, the Siamese cats sold for $20 each.\n\n2. Now, let's find out how many Siamese cats are left:\n\n41 cats - 15 cats = 26 cats\n\nSo, there are 26 Siamese cats left.\n\n3. Next, let's find out how many House cats were sold:\n\n15 cats - 28 cats = -13 cats (since there are fewer House cats than Siamese cats)\n\nSo, there are -13 House cats left (i.e., none).\n\n4. Finally, let's add the number of Siamese cats and House cats left:\n\n26 Siamese cats + 0 House cats = 26 cats\n\nSo, there are 26 cats left in the pet store after the sale.\n\nI hope that helps!

If he had to pick up 17 trays from one table and 55 trays from another, how many trips will he make?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I can help you with that! To solve this problem, we can use a system of linear equations.\n\nLet's say Dave makes x trips to pick up the 17 trays from the first table, and y trips to pick up the 55 trays from the second table.\n\nWe know that Dave can carry 9 trays at a time, so we can set up the following equation:\n\n9x + 9y = 17 + 55\n\nSimplifying the equation, we get:\n\n9x + 9y = 72\n\nNow, we can solve for x and y. To do this, we can subtract 9x from both sides of the equation:\n\n9x + 9y - 9x = 72 - 9x\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\n9y = 63\n\nNow, we can divide both sides of the equation by 9 to solve for y:\n\ny = 7\n\nNow that we have found y, we can find x by substituting y into the first equation:\n\n9x + 9y = 72\n\nSubstituting y = 7, we get:\n\n9x + 9(7) = 72\n\n9x + 63 = 72\n\n9x = 9\n\nx = 10\n\nSo, Dave will make 10 trips to pick up the 17 trays from the first table, and 7 trips to pick up the 55 trays from the second table.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nDave will make a total of 10 + 7 = 17 trips.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

To find out how many pictures were in each of the albums, we can use a system of linear equations. Let's say that Tiffany uploaded x pictures from her phone and y pictures from her camera.\n\nSince there are 5 albums in total, we can set up the following equation:\n\nx + y = 7 (photos from phone)\nx + y = 13 (photos from camera)\n\nWe know that x and y are both positive integers, so we can write:\n\nx = 7 - 5k (k is a positive integer)\ny = 13 - 5l (l is a positive integer)\n\nwhere k and l are the number of albums Tiffany has with photos from her phone and camera, respectively.\n\nSubstituting the expressions for x and y into the first equation, we get:\n\n7 - 5k + 13 - 5l = 7\n\nCombine like terms:\n\n2k + 2l = 0\n\nSince 2k and 2l are both even, we know that k and l must both be even. Therefore, we can write:\n\nk = 2r (r is an integer)\nl = 2s (s is an integer)\n\nSubstituting these expressions into the equation, we get:\n\n2r + 2s = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\nr + s = 0\n\nSince r and s are both integers, we know that r + s must be an integer. Therefore, we can write:\n\nr = -s\n\nSubstituting this expression into the equation, we get:\n\n2r + 2s = 0\n\nSimplifying:\n\n2(-s) + 2s = 0\n\nTherefore, we have:\n\n-2s = 0\n\nSolving for s, we get:\n\ns = 0\n\nSince s is an integer, we know that Tiffany must have 0 albums with photos from her camera. Therefore, we can conclude that Tiffany has 5 albums with photos from her phone, each containing 7 - 5k = 2 pictures.\n\nSo, the answer is:\n\nThere are ", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say Rachel has colored x pictures from the first coloring book, since it has 23 pictures.\n2. She has colored y pictures from the second coloring book, since it has 32 pictures.\n3. In total, Rachel has colored x + y pictures.\n4. We know that the total number of pictures Rachel has colored is 44 (since she has colored 44 pictures after one week).\n5. So, we can set up the equation: x + y = 44.\n6. Now, we can solve for x by subtracting y from both sides of the equation:\n\nx + y = 44\nx + y - y = 44 - y\nx = 44 - y\n\n7. Since we know that y = 32 (since the second coloring book has 32 pictures), we can substitute y = 32 into the equation:\n\nx = 44 - 32\nx = 12\n\n8.

If only 19 of the carrots were good, how many bad carrots did they have?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's say the number of good carrots picked by Olivia is x. Then, the number of bad carrots picked by Olivia is 20 - x.\n2. Since her mother picked 14 carrots, the number of good carrots picked by her mother is y. The number of bad carrots picked by her mother is 14 - y.\n3. We know that only 19 of the carrots were good, so we can set up the equation: x + y = 19.\n4. We also know that Olivia picked 20 carrots, so we can set up the equation: 20 - x + y = 0.\n5. Now we have two equations and two unknowns. We can use substitution or elimination to solve for x and y. Let's use substitution.\n6. Solving the first equation for x, we get:\n\nx = 19 - y\n\nNow, substituting this expression for x in the second equation, we get:\n\n20 - (19 - y) + y = 0\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\ny = 1\n\nSo, Olivia picked 19 good carrots and her mother picked 1 good carrot.\n\nTherefore, the number of bad carrots picked by Olivia is 20 - 19 = 1, and the number of bad carrots picked by her mother is 14 - 1 = 13.\n\nI hope this helps!

He put 17 of them in one load, but decided to split the rest into 5 equal loads. How many pieces of clothing could go in each of the small loads?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I can help you with that! To solve this problem, we can use a simple division strategy.\n\nLet's start by identifying the total number of pieces of clothing Luke has to wash:\n\n47 pieces of clothing\n\nLuke put 17 pieces in one load, so the number of pieces left to distribute among the remaining 5 loads is:\n\n47 - 17 = 30\n\nSince Luke wants to split the remaining 30 pieces into 5 equal loads, we can divide 30 by 5 to find out how many pieces can go in each load:\n\n30 \u00f7 5 = 6\n\nSo, each of the remaining 5 loads can have 6 pieces of clothing.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is:\n\n6 pieces of clothing can go in each of the small loads.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

If he got $8 each from the ones who did tip, how much money did he earn?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we can use a step-by-step approach as you suggested. Here's the solution:\n\n1. First, let's find out how much the waiter earned from the customers who tipped. Since 5 out of 9 customers didn't tip, we know that 4 customers tipped.\n2. We know that each customer who tipped gave $8, so the total amount the waiter earned from the tipping customers is:\n\n4 customers x $8 per customer = $32\n\nSo, the waiter earned $32 from the customers who tipped.\n3. Now, we need to find out how much the waiter earned in total. Since 5 customers didn't tip, we know that the waiter didn't earn anything from those customers.\n4. Therefore, the waiter's total earnings are the amount he earned from the tipping customers plus the amount he earned from the non-tipping customers. Since the non-tipping customers didn't pay anything, the waiter's total earnings are just the amount he earned from the tipping customers:\n\nTotal earnings = $32\n\nSo, the waiter earned $32 in total.\n\nI hope this helps!

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. First, we need to find out how many friends will be attending the party. Since 4 couldn't come, we need to subtract 4 from 9:\n\n9 - 4 = 5\n\nSo, there will be 5 friends attending the party.\n\n2. Next, we need to find out how many cupcakes each person will need. Since each person needs exactly 8 cupcakes, we can multiply the number of attending friends by 8:\n\n5 x 8 = 40\n\nSo, Will needs to buy 40 cupcakes in total.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is: Will needs to buy 40 cupcakes.\n\nI hope that helps!

Here's the solution step by step:\n\n1. Let's start by identifying what we know:\n\t* Adam bought 13 tickets.\n\t* After riding the ferris wheel, Adam had 4 tickets left.\n2. Now, let's think about how many tickets Adam used to ride the ferris wheel:\n\t* To find out how many tickets Adam used, we need to subtract the number of tickets he had left from the number of tickets he bought:\n\t\n\t\n\t13 - 4 = 9\n3. So, Adam used 9 tickets to ride the ferris wheel.\n4. Now, let's calculate how much money Adam spent riding the ferris wheel:\n\t* Since each ticket costs $9, we can multiply the number of tickets Adam used by the cost of each ticket to find out how much he spent:\n\t\n\t\n\t9 x 9 = 81\n5. So, Adam spent $81 riding the ferris wheel.\n\nTherefore, the answer to your question is:\n\nAdam spent $81 riding the ferris wheel.\n\nI hope this helps!

If it takes 4 hours to install each window, how long will it take him to install the rest?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help you with that! To find out how long it will take the builder to install the rest of the windows, we can use a simple subtraction problem.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many windows the builder has already installed:\n\n5 windows x 4 hours per window = 20 hours\n\nNow, we know that the builder has already installed 5 windows, so he has 14 - 5 = 9 windows left to install.\n\nSince each window takes 4 hours to install, we can multiply the number of windows left to install by the time it takes to install each window:\n\n9 windows x 4 hours per window = 36 hours\n\nTherefore, it will take the builder 36 hours to install the rest of the windows.\n\nI hope that helps!

To solve this problem, we need to break it down into smaller parts and tackle each step one at a time. Here's how we can do it:\n\n1. First, let's look at the math problems. Nancy can finish 8 problems in an hour, so if she has 17 math problems, it will take her:\n\n17 / 8 = 2 hours to finish all the math problems.\n\n2. Now, let's look at the spelling problems. If Nancy can finish 8 problems in an hour, and she has 15 spelling problems, it will take her:\n\n15 / 8 = 2 hours to finish all the spelling problems.\n\n3. Now that we know how long it will take Nancy to finish each set of problems, we can add the two times together to find out how long it will take her to finish all the problems:\n\n2 hours (math) + 2 hours (spelling) = 4 hours\n\nSo, it will take Nancy 4 hours to finish all her homework.\n\nI hope that helps!

If she used 6 cups of flour on each one, how much cups of flour does she still need?  \n    Let's think step by step\n[/INST]\n     Sure, I'd be happy to help! To solve this problem, we need to find out how much flour Chloe still needs. Let's start by using the information we know:\n\n1. Chloe baked 7 brownies.\n2. She needed 16 brownies in total for her party.\n3. She used 6 cups of flour on each brownie.\n\nSo, let's do some math:\n\n16 (total brownies needed) - 7 (brownies baked) = 9 (brownies still needed)\n\nNow, we know that each brownie requires 6 cups of flour, so we can calculate how much flour Chloe still needs as follows:\n\n9 (brownies still needed) x 6 (cups of flour per brownie) = 54 (cups of flour still needed)\n\nTherefore, Chloe still needs 54 cups of flour to make the remaining 9 brownies.\n\nI hope this helps!
