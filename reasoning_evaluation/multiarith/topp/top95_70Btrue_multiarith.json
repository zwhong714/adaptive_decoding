To solve this problem, we need to find out how many pictures Rachel has colored in total and then subtract that number from the total number of pictures in the two coloring books.\n\nLet's start by finding out how many pictures Rachel has colored in total. We know that she colored 4 pictures from the first coloring book, which has 24 pictures. So, the number of pictures she colored from the first book is 4/24 = 1/6.\n\nNow, we need to find out how many pictures she colored from the second coloring book. We know that the second book has 39 pictures, and we want to find out how many of those pictures Rachel has colored. We can do this by multiplying the number of pictures in the second book by the fraction of pictures she colored from the first book: 39 x 1/6 = 6.5.\n\nSo, Rachel has colored a total of 4 + 6.5 = 10.5 pictures.\n\nNow, let's find out how many pictures she still has to color. We can do this by subtracting the number of pictures she colored from the total number of pictures in the two coloring books: 24 + 39 - 10.5 = 52.5.\n\nTherefore, Rachel still has 52.5 pictures to color.\n\nI hope this helps!

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:\n\nStep 1: Find the total number of cats the pet store had before the sale.\nTotal number of cats = number of Siamese cats + number of house cats\nTotal number of cats = 41 + 28\nTotal number of cats = 69\n\nStep 2: Find the number of cats sold during the sale.\nNumber of cats sold = 15\n\nStep 3: Find the number of cats left after the sale by subtracting the number of cats sold from the total number of cats.\nNumber of cats left = total number of cats - number of cats sold\nNumber of cats left = 69 - 15\nNumber of cats left = 54\n\nTherefore, the pet store has 54 cats left after the sale.\n\nSo, the answer is 54.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

If she made 31 cookies and had 32 pastries left, that means she sold 31 - 32 = -1 cookies.\n\nWait, that doesn't make sense! If she sold -1 cookies, that means she didn't sell any cookies at all. But we know she sold some pastries, so something must be wrong with our calculation.\n\nLet's double-check our calculation:\n\n* 41 cupcakes - 32 left = 9 sold\n* 31 cookies - 32 left = -1 sold\n\nHmm, it looks like we made a mistake in our calculation. Let's try again.\n\nThis time, let's use a different approach. We know that Wendy had 32 pastries left after the sale, so let's subtract the number of pastries she made from the number of pastries she had left:\n\n* 32 pastries left - 41 cupcakes made = -9 cupcakes sold\n* 32 pastries left - 31 cookies made = 1 cookie sold\n\nNow, this makes more sense! We can see that Wendy sold 9 cupcakes and 1 cookie.\n\nSo, to answer your question, Wendy sold 9 cupcakes and 1 cookie at the school bake sale.\n\nI hope that helps!

So, we'll need at least 2 vases to hold all the carnations.\n\nWe can put 6 carnations in the first vase, leaving 1 carnation left over.\n\nNow, let's think about the roses. We have 47 roses, and we know that 6 roses can fit in a vase. So, we'll need 47/6 = 7 vases to hold all the roses.\n\nBut wait, we've already used 2 vases to hold the carnations! So, we'll actually need 7 - 2 = 5 additional vases to hold the roses.\n\nTherefore, to hold all 7 carnations and 47 roses, we'll need a total of 2 + 5 = 7 vases.\n\nSo, the answer to the problem is 7 vases.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.

First, we need to find out how many students were picked for the team. We can do this by subtracting the number of students who didn't get picked (15) from the total number of students (25):\n\n25 - 15 = 10\n\nSo, 10 students were picked for the team.\n2. Next, we need to find out how many students are left over after the 10 students were picked. We can do this by subtracting the number of students picked (10) from the total number of students (25):\n\n25 - 10 = 15\n\nSo, there are 15 students left over.\n3. Now, we need to divide the remaining 15 students into 2 groups. We can do this by dividing 15 by 2:\n\n15 \u00f7 2 = 7.5\n\nSince we can't have a fraction of a student, we'll round up to the nearest whole number. So, there will be 8 students in each group.\n\nTherefore, the answer to the problem is: there will be 8 students in each group.", "[INST] <<SYS>>You are a help assistant and a math expert.
